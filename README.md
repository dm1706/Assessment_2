diabetes
The dataset represents ten years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. Each row concerns hospital records of patients diagnosed with diabetes, who underwent laboratory, medications, and stayed up to 14 days. The goal is to determine the early readmission of the patient within 30 days of discharge.
This is a basic data analysis and does not provide definitive conclusions. Further research is needed to validate the findings.
Readmission rates may be influenced by hospital stay, medication counts, and lab procedures.
Racial disparities and high-risk patients with more medications require further attention.
